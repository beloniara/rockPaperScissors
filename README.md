Rock Paper Scissors game for TOP

The odin project only wants the game to be played within 5 rounds.  But as kids, that is not how we play rock paper scissors.  What we do is we play until someone reaches a certain score, be it 5 points or higher.  So my code reflects that.  This Rock Paper Scissors game will continue until either the Player or Computer reaches 5 points.  Whoever gets 5 points first will be the winner.
